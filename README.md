# Bank-System
A simple bank system written in C++ which I used to learn the basics of the C++ language. Written for Windows exclusively.

## About
C++ was a language I was really interested in for a long time but just needed a project to use it on. I decided to make a bank system as it's something that was simple to understand but would allow me to test as much features of the language as I wished. Throughout development of this program, I got to learn not only how to use C++ but also troubleshooting compilation issues and any other quirks the language has which was a very enjoyable journey.

## Features
- Adding and deleting multiple bank accounts
- Randomly generated bank account details
- Depositing money into accounts
- Ability to transfer money between accounts

## Things I've learnt
- Basics of C++ syntax, grammar and capabilities

- Translation units and header files
- Fixing C++ compiler and linker errors

## Usage
```
- Run the BankSystem.exe executable binary
  .\BankSystem.exe (or double click it in the file explorer)
